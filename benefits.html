					<div id="benefits_description">Pets offer many benefits to humans, no matter what species the pet is. However, one species of pet in particular prevails over all other species of pets: Cats. Humans and cats have a symbiotic relationship with one another. Cats offer a wide range of benefits to their owners when they are well-cared for, and humans offer a great number of benefits to their cats in return. Cats make the most ideal companions for humans, and following are a few of many reasons why.</div><!--End of benefits_description-->

					<div class="benefit_description">
						If you are stressed about school, work, or life in general, having a cat can help with that. Simply having a cat in your life causes your body to release various calming chemicals. When these chemicals are released, your levels of stress and anxiety are significantly decreased. In the long-term, these reduced stress levels can also decrease your risk of heart disease. The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed your cat will be, resulting in a healthier and happier life for both the cat and the owner.

					<div class="benefit_description">If you struggle to sleep at night, having a cat may help you get your much needed rest. A study conducted by the Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine reveals that many people claim to sleep better when they are snuggled with their cat or their cat is on the same bed. The majority of espondents of the survey in the study also state that they sleep better with their cat than they do with another human. Additionally, many breeds of cats also sleep better with another living being than alone, offering mutual benefits to cats and humans.

					<div class="benefit_description">If you fear getting a pet because of the amount of maintinence involved in caring for one, cats are a great solution. The care cats require is simple: Feed them, supply them with water, and clean their litter box. Aside from these tasks, the only other thing cats require is love. When these simple methods of care are handled, cats will never cause a problem. After all, cats sleep most of the day anyway, so they will never disturb you when you need to work. At the same time, you will enjoy their presence and they will appreciate having a loving owner.
